# Digital Logbook
A web application for internship tracking

This project aims to help students keep track of their daily activities, events, and tasks during their internship semester.

## About the Project

### Motivation
As an intern myself, I experienced the difficulty of recalling past tasks and activities after a few months. This project's purpose is to provide students with a centralized platform to document their internship journey for future reference.

### Why I Built It
This project addresses a real-life problem faced by many interns. Having a digital logbook allows students to maintain an organized record of their internship experience.

### Problem Solved
Digital Logbook eliminates the issue of scattered or forgotten internship activities. By logging daily entries, students can easily access and review their experiences at any time.

### Learnings
This project fostered my development skills across various areas:

- Project development from ideation to execution
- Utilizing Supabase (BaaS) with React JS
- Fundamentals of testing (Vitest & React Testing Library)
- Honing React development skills

### What Makes it Stand Out
Digital Logbook offers a valuable tool for internship management. I actively use it, and it will soon be shared with fellow students.

## Key Features
- **User Management and Data Protection:** Ensures user data is secure and protected.
- **Daily Logging:** Enables users to fill out a daily log form. They can only fill the form once. Edits can be made to the already filled daily log.
- **Mobile Accessibility:** Optimized for viewing and interacting with on mobile devices.

## Tech Stack
- **Client:** React JS, Typescript, SCSS, Context API
- **Backend as a Service:** Supabase
- **Testing Frameworks:** Vitest, React Testing Library
